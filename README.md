## 🌟 Highlight Projects

<details>
<summary>🚗 **ADAS with V2V Wireless Communication</summary>

**Description:**  
Developed an *Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS)* using **Raspberry Pi**, **STM32**, and **ESP8266** for vehicle-to-vehicle communication.

**Features:**  
- Drowsiness detection, sign recognition, adaptive cruise control, and lane detection.  
- Two-way V2V communication using **ESP-NOW** and **LPWAN** protocols.  
- Custom **Yocto-based Linux image** and **Qt5 GUI** for infotainment.  

**My Role:**  
- Implemented and integrated FreeRTOS-based logic on STM32.  
- Built CAN communication between STM32 and Raspberry Pi via MCP2515/MCP2551.  
- Established and benchmarked wireless protocols (ESP-NOW vs LPWAN).
